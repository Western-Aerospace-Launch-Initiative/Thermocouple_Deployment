# PEP_GS_Main Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the PEP_GS_Main Application

In order to build the PEP_GS_Main application, or any other FÂ´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd PEP_GS_Main
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the PEP_GS_Main application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd PEP_GS_Main
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the PEP_GS_Main app:
```
cd PEP_GS_Main
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd PEP_GS_Main/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./PEP_GS_Main -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```
